'''Belgium''' (officially the '''Kingdom of Belgium'''; {{lang-nl|Koninkrijk België}}, {{lang-de|Königreich Belgien}}, {{lang-fr|Royaume de Belgique}}) is a [[country]] in [[Western Europe]]. Its capital, [[Brussels]], is the home of many organizations including the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. Belgium is bordered by [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] in the north, [[Germany]] to the east, [[Luxembourg]] to the southeast and [[France]] to the south.

Belgium has an area of {{convert|30689|km2|sqmi}}. Around 11.6 million people live in Belgium. It is a founding member of the [[European Union]] and is home to its headquarters.

== Regions ==
There are three regions in Belgium. The regions are mainly based on language and culture. Flanders and Wallonia are both split up into five [[Province|provinces]] each.
* [[Flanders]] is the name of the northern half of Belgium, just south of the [[Netherlands]]. Most of the people in this region, called the ''Flemish people'', speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]].
* [[Wallonia]] is the name of the southern half of Belgium, just north of [[France]]. Here, most of the people, the ''Walloons'', speak [[French language|French]]. There is a small part of Wallonia next to the border with [[Germany]] where the people speak [[German language|German]].
* The [[Brussels-Capital Region]], where the capital of Brussels is found, is in the middle of the country, but surrounded by Flanders [[Enclave|on all sides]]. It used to be Dutch-speaking, but today French is mostly spoken, with some Dutch.
The population is about 60% Dutch-speaking, 39% French-speaking, and 1% German-speaking (the so-called ''Deutschbelgier''). To look after all these groups, Belgium has a complex system of [[government]] with highly [[autonomous]] regions.

==History==
[[File:Map Burgundian Netherlands 1477-en.png|thumb|left|The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (orange, brown and yellow areas) and the [[Bishopric of Liège]] (green)]]
The name 'Belgium' comes from ''[[Gallia Belgica]]''. This was a [[Roman province]] in the northernmost part of [[Gaul]]. Before Roman invasion in 100&nbsp;BC, the ''[[Belgae]]'', a mix of [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]], lived there.<ref>{{Cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire]] |author=Bunson, Matthew

The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the [[Southern Netherlands]]. Southern Netherlands were ruled by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg]]s. This made up most of modern Belgium.

After the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries were added into the [[French First Republic]]. This ended Austrian rule in the area. Adding back the Low Countries formed the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. This happened at the end of the [[First French Empire]] in 1815.

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 gave control of the [[Congo Free State]] to [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold&nbsp;II]]. Millions of Congolese people were hurt or killed, mostly to make [[rubber]], and Leopold became very wealthy.

Germany invaded Belgium in 1914. This was part of [[World War I]]. The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium. During the war Belgium took over [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern-day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]). After the War, the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] were added into Belgium in 1925. [[Battle of Belgium|The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940]] and under German control until 1944. After World War II, the people made king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] leave his throne in 1951. This is because they thought he helped the Germans. Belgium joined [[NATO]] as a founding member.

In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1304803 |title=The Congolese Civil War 1960–1964 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=April 29, 2010 }}</ref> Two years later Ruanda-Urundi also became free.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Belgium}}

Belgium is next to [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Its total area is 34,143&nbsp;[[square kilometers]] (including sea area).<ref name="area" /> The land area alone is 30,689&nbsp;km², of which 195&nbsp;km² or 0.64% are inland and coastal waters.<ref name="area" /> Belgium has three main geographical regions. The coastal plain is in the north-west. The central plateau are part of the Anglo-Belgian Basin. The [[Ardennes (forest)|Ardennes]] uplands are in the south-east. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine.

The coastal plain is mostly [[sand dune]]s and [[polder]]s. Further inland is a smooth, slowly rising landscape. There are fertile [[valley]]s. The hills have many forests. The [[plateau]]s of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky. They have caves and small, narrow valleys. Signal de Botrange is the country's highest point at 694 metres (2,277&nbsp;ft).

===Regions===
Belgium is divided into three regions: [[Flemish Region]] (Flanders), [[Walloon Region]] (Wallonia), and [[Brussels-Capital Region]] (Brussels Region or Brussels - also the name of the city):

Flanders and Wallonia are divided into provinces. Brussels (Region) is not part of any province.

== Politics ==
[[File:Koning Filip van België.jpg|thumb|230x230px|[[Philippe of Belgium]], current King.]]
Since 1993, Belgium is a [[federation|federal]] state, divided into three regions and three communities.

Regions:
* [[Brussels-Capital Region]]
* [[Flemish Region]] (or Flanders)
* [[Walloon Region]] (or Wallonia)

Communities:
* [[Flemish Community]]
* [[French Community of Belgium]]
* [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]]

It has a system of [[government]] known as a [[constitutional monarchy]], meaning that it has a [[monarch]], but that the monarch does not rule the country, and that a government is elected [[Democracy|democratically]].

Belgium has had its own monarchy since 1831. King [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] left the throne on July 21, 2013 and the current king is [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]].

In Belgium, the government is elected. Between mid-2010 and late 2011, after no clear result in the [[election]], Belgium had no official government, until [[Elio Di Rupo]] became [[Prime Minister]]. [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]] both also have their own regional governments, and there is a notable independence movement in Flanders. [[Alexander De Croo]] is currently the Prime Minister.

==Military==
The Belgian Armed Forces have about 46,000 active troops. In 2009 the yearly defence budget was $6 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/DefenceData |title=Defence Data Portal |publisher=[[European Defence Agency]] |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref> There are four parts: Belgian Land Component, or the Army; Belgian Air Component, or the Air Force; Belgian Naval Component, or the Navy; Belgian Medical Component.

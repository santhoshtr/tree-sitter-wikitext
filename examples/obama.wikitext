The infobox is there to include additional occupations.-->who was the 44th [[president of the United States]] from 2009 to 2017. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was the first [[African American]] president. Obama previously served as a [[U.S. senator]] representing [[Illinois]] from 2005 to 2008 and as an [[Illinois state senator]] from 1997 to 2004.<!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE FROM "AFRICAN AMERICAN", per consensus. See discussions and FAQ (Q2) on the talk page.-->

Born in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, Obama graduated from [[Columbia University]] in 1983 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in political science and later worked as a [[community organizer]] in [[Chicago]]. In 1988, Obama enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching [[constitutional law]] at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. In 1996, Obama was elected to [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represent the 13th district in the Illinois Senate]], a position he held until 2004, when he [[2004 United States Senate election in Illinois|successfully ran for the U.S. Senate]]. In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], after [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|a close primary campaign]] against [[Hillary Clinton]], he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama selected [[Joe Biden]] as his running mate and defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[John McCain]] and his running mate [[Sarah Palin]].

Obama was awarded the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] for efforts in international diplomacy, a decision which drew both criticism and praise. During his first term, his administration responded to the [[2008 financial crisis]] with measures including the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], a major stimulus package to guide the economy in recovering from the [[Great Recession]]; a partial extension of the [[Bush tax cuts]]; [[Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration|legislation to reform health care]]; and the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], a major financial regulation reform bill. Obama also appointed [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]], the former being the first [[Hispanic American]] on the Supreme Court. He oversaw the end of the [[Iraq War]] and ordered [[Operation Neptune Spear]], the raid that killed [[Osama bin Laden]], who was responsible for the [[September 11 attacks]]. Obama downplayed Bush's [[counterinsurgency]] model, expanding [[air strikes]] and making extensive use of special forces, while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. He also ordered the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]], contributing to the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and the outbreak of the [[Libyan crisis (2011–present)|Libyan crisis]].

Obama defeated Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]] and his running mate [[Paul Ryan (politician)|Paul Ryan]] in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]]. In his second term, Obama advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in the wake of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], took steps to [[combat climate change]], signing the [[Paris Agreement]], a major international climate agreement, and an [[executive order]] to limit [[carbon emission]]s. Obama also presided over the implementation of the [[Affordable Care Act]] and other legislation passed in his first term. He initiated [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|invasion in Ukraine]] and again after [[Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections]], ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|military intervention in Iraq]] in response to gains made by [[ISIL]] following the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, negotiated the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]] (a nuclear agreement with Iran), and [[Cuban thaw|normalized relations with Cuba]]. The number of [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)|American soldiers in Afghanistan]] decreased during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout the remainder of his presidency. Obama promoted inclusion for [[LGBT Americans]], becoming the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]].

Obama left office in 2017 with high approval ratings both within the United States and among foreign advisories. He continues to reside in Washington D.C. and remains politically active, campaigning for candidates in various American elections, including in Biden's [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|successful presidential bid]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]]. Outside of politics, [[Bibliography of Barack Obama|Obama has published three books]]: ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' (1995)'', [[The Audacity of Hope]]'' (2006), and ''[[A Promised Land]]'' (2020). [[Barack Obama Presidential Center|His presidential library]] began construction in the [[South Side of Chicago]] in 2021. Historians and political scientists rank Obama among the upper tier in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary|historical rankings of U.S. presidents]].

===Religious views===
Obama is a [[Protestant]] Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.<ref name="Christian" /> He wrote in ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'' that he "was not raised in a religious household." He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person{{nbsp}}... I have ever known", and "a lonely witness for [[secular humanism]]." He described his father as a "confirmed [[Atheism|atheist]]" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with [[black church]]es as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."<ref name="social change" />

In January 2008, Obama told ''[[Christianity Today]]'': "I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian.

Obama called for [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass legislation reforming [[health care in the United States]], a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.<ref name="health reform" /> He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs.

It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s, and require every American to carry health coverage.

On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The "Complex Modernization" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. In November 2013, the Obama administration opened [[Negotiations leading to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|negotiations]] with Iran to prevent it from acquiring [[nuclear weapon]]s, which included an [[Joint Plan of Action|interim agreement]]. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Iran deal reached, Obama hails step toward 'more hopeful world' |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-idUSKCN0PM0CE20150714 |date = July 14, 2015 |access-date = July 14, 2015 |work = Reuters }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title = Iran, World Powers Prepare to Sign Nuclear Accord |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/embargo-on-arms-clouds-iran-nuclear-deal-1436831280 |date = July 14, 2015 |access-date = July 14, 2015 |newspaper = The Wall Street Journal |last1 = Solomon |first1 = Jay |last2 = Norman |first2 = Laurence |last3 = Lee |first3 = Carol E. }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title = Landmark deal reached on Iran nuclear program |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal/ |date = July 14, 2015 |access-date = July 14, 2015 |publisher = CNN }}</ref> In addition, the transfer of $1.7{{spaces}}billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party.

=== Thanks, Obama ===
{{Main|Thanks, Obama}}
In 2009, the saying "thanks, Obama" first appeared in a [[Twitter|Twitter hashtag]], "#thanks Obama", and was later used in a demotivational poster. It was later adopted satirically to blame Obama for any socio-economic ills. Obama himself used the phrase in video in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, the phrase was used by [[Stephen Colbert]] to express gratitude to Obama on his last day in office. In 2022, President Joe Biden's Twitter account posted the phrase.

And—but I have known Trinity even before then when I was a community organizer on the South Side, helping steel workers find jobs{{spaces}}... Garrett: As a member in good standing, were you a regular attendee of Sunday services? Obama: You know, I won't say that I was a perfect attendee. I was regular in spurts, because there was times when, for example, our child had just been born, our first child. And so we didn't go as regularly then. }}

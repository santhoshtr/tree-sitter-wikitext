'''Oxygen''' is a [[chemical element]]. It has the symbol '''O''' and [[atomic number]] 8. It is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas at room temperature. Oxygen is part of the air we breathe. It makes up about 21% of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth’s atmosphere]]. It is the third most common [[chemical element|element]] in the [[universe]], after [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. Oxygen is part of the [[Group 16 element|chalcogen]] [[group (periodic table)|group]] on the [[periodic table]]. Oxygen is very reactive, meaning it easily combines with other elements. It often forms [[oxide]]s, like [[iron oxide]] (rust) or [[carbon dioxide]] (CO₂). It supports [[combustion]], which means it helps things burn, but it does not burn by itself. In its most common form, oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule (O₂), meaning two oxygen atoms are joined together. There is also a special form called ozone (O₃), made of three oxygen atoms. [[Ozone]] is more reactive than normal oxygen and helps protect [[Earth]] by blocking harmful [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet (UV) rays]] from the Sun. Oxygen supports [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], the process living things use to turn food into energy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Oxygen - Element information, properties and uses {{!}} Periodic Table|url=https://periodic-table.rsc.org/element/8/oxygen|access-date=2025-05-26|website=periodic-table.rsc.org}}</ref>

Oxygen is one of the most common elements on Earth. It makes up about 21% of the [[air]] in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], which is the part we breathe. It is also found in the [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[river]]s as part of [[water]] (H₂O). Oxygen is also found in [[rock]]s, [[mineral]]s, and [[soil]]. It makes up almost half of the [[Earth's crust|Earth’s crust]] by weight, because it is part of many [[chemical compound|compound]]s like [[silicate]]s and [[oxide]]s. These are the building blocks of rocks and minerals. [[Plant]]s, [[algae]], and some [[Cyanobacteria|bacteria]] make oxygen during [[photosynthesis]]. They take in [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sunlight]] to produce [[food]] and release oxygen as a [[byproduct]]. Many [[organic compounds|molecule]]s in living things have oxygen in them, such as [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]]s. Oxygen is also found in [[Outer space|space]]. It can be found in [[star]]s and in [[Molecular cloud|clouds of gas]] between stars. Scientists have even found oxygen in the ice and rocks on other [[planet]]s and [[Natural satellite|moon]]s.<ref name=":2" />

The history of oxygen began in the 1700s, during a time when scientists were starting to understand the nature of air. In 1772, Swedish chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] discovered a gas that made [[flame]]s burn brighter, but he did not publish his work right away. A few years later, in 1774, British scientist [[Joseph Priestley]] also discovered this gas by heating a substance called [[mercuric oxide]]. He noticed that [[candle]]s burned more strongly in the [[gas]], and mice lived longer when breathing it. He called it "dephlogisticated air" based on an old theory of combustion. Soon after, French scientist Antoine [[Lavoisier]] gave the gas its modern name, oxygen, which means “acid-former” in Greek. He helped disprove the old phlogiston theory. He also showed that oxygen is an important part of [[combustion]] and [[respiration]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

Oxygen can be produced in several ways. The most common method for making large amounts of oxygen is called [[fractional distillation of liquid air]]. In this process, [[air]] is cooled until it becomes a [[liquid]], then slowly warmed up. Because oxygen boils at a different temperature than other gases, it can be separated and collected. Another way to produce oxygen is by using [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]]. This method involves passing [[electricity]] through [[water]] (H₂O) to split it into [[hydrogen]] and oxygen gas. Oxygen is also made naturally by [[plant]]s, [[algae]], and some [[Cyanobacteria|bacteria]] through the process of photosynthesis. These organisms take in carbon dioxide and sunlight to make food, and they release oxygen into the air. This natural process is the main source of the oxygen we breathe every day. In [[hospital]]s, oxygen can also be created using [[oxygen concentrator]]s, which pull oxygen out of the air and remove other gases. This helps people who have trouble breathing or need extra oxygen for medical treatments. Oxygen can be stored as a gas under pressure in tanks or stored as a liquid.<ref name=":2" />

Oxygen has many important uses in everyday life, [[medicine]], and [[industry]]. One of the most important uses is for [[breathing]]. [[Hospital]]s give oxygen to patients who have trouble breathing or need extra oxygen, especially during [[surgery]] or emergencies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Medical use of Oxygen|url=https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-policy-and-standards/assistive-and-medical-technology/medical-devices/oxygen|access-date=2025-05-26|website=www.who.int|language=en}}</ref> Oxygen is also used in industry.

==History==
Oxygen gas ({{chem|O|2}}) was [[chemical isolation|isolated]] by [[Michael Sendivogius]] before 1604. It is often thought that the gas was discovered in 1773 by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]], in [[Sweden]], or in 1774 by [[Joseph Priestley]], in [[England]]. Priestley is usually thought to be the main discoverer because his work was published first (although he called it "[[Phlogiston theory|dephlogisticated air]]", and did not think it was a [[chemical element]]). [[Antoine Lavoisier]] gave the name ''oxygène'' to the gas in 1777. He was the first person to say it was a chemical element. He was also right about how it helps [[combustion]] work.

=== Early experiments ===
One of the first known [[experiment]]s on how [[combustion]] needs [[air]] was carried out by [[Greece|Greek]] [[Philo of Byzantium]] in the 2nd century&nbsp;[[BC]]. He wrote in his work ''Pneumatica'' that turning a [[wikt:Vessel|vessel]] upside down over a burning [[candle]] and putting water around this vessel meant that some water went into the vessel.<ref>{{cite book|title = Story of Human Error|first = Joseph |last = Jastrow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRUO45YfCHwC&pg=PA171|page= 171 |date = 1936|publisher = Ayer Publishing|isbn = 978-0-8369-0568-7}}</ref> Philo thought this was because the air was turned into the [[classical element]] fire. This is wrong. A long time after, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] worked out that some air was used up during combustion, and this forced water into the vessel.<ref name="ECE499">Cook, Gerhard A. & Lauer, Carol M. 1968. "Oxygen". In Clifford A. Hampel (ed.). The Encyclopedia of the Chemical Elements. New York: Reinhold Book Corporation. pp. 499–512. LCCN 68-29938.
 p499.</ref>

In the late 17th&nbsp;century, [[Robert Boyle]] found that air is needed for combustion. [[England|English]] [[chemist]] [[John Mayow]] added to this by showing that fire only needed a part of air. We now call this oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Mayow, John|volume=17|pages=938–939}}</ref> He found that a candle burning in a closed container made the water rise to replace a fourteenth of the air's [[volume]] before it went out.<ref name="WoC">{{cite book|title=World of Chemistry|date=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=978-0-669-32727-4|chapter=John Mayow|access-date=December 16, 2007|chapter-url=http://www.bookrags.com/John_Mayow}}</ref> The same thing happened when a live [[mouse]] was put into the box. From this, he worked out that oxygen is used for both respiration and combustion.

===Phlogiston theory===
{{main|Phlogiston theory}}

[[Robert Hooke]], [[Ole Borch]], [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Pierre Bayen]] all made oxygen in experiments in the 17th and 18th centuries. None of them thought it was a [[chemical element]].<ref name="NBB299">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p.299</ref> This was probably because of the idea of the ''phlogiston theory''. This was what most people believed caused combustion and [[corrosion]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Best | first1 = Nicholas W. | year = 2015 | title = Lavoisier's 'Reflections on Phlogiston' I: Against Phlogiston Theory | journal = Foundations of Chemistry | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 137–151 | doi=10.1007/s10698-015-9220-5| s2cid = 170422925  |issn = 1386-4238}}</ref>

[[J. J. Becher]] came up with the theory in 1667, and [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] added to it in 1731.<ref name="morris">{{cite book| title = The last sorcerers: The path from alchemy to the periodic table

One part, called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was burned.<ref name="ECE499"/>

Materials that leave very little [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] when they burn, like [[wood]] or [[coal]], were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston. Things that [[corrode]], like [[iron]], were thought to contain very little. Air was not part of this theory.<ref name="ECE499"/>

===Discovery===
[[Poland|Polish]] [[Alchemy|alchemist]], [[philosopher]] and [[physician]] [[Michael Sendivogius]] wrote about something in air that he called the "food of life",<ref name="Marples">{{cite web |last1=Marples |first1=Frater James A. |title=Michael Sendivogius, Rosicrucian, and father of studies of oxygen |url=http://www.masonic.benemerito.net/msricf/papers/marples/marples-michael.sendivogius.pdf |publisher=Societas Rosicruciana in Civitatibus Foederatis, Nebraska College |access-date=May 25, 2018 |pages=3–4 |archive-date=May 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200508172910/http://www.masonic.benemerito.net/msricf/papers/marples/marples-michael.sendivogius.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> and this meant what we now call oxygen.<ref name="Bugaj">{{cite journal |last1= Bugaj|first1= Roman|title= Michał Sędziwój - Traktat o Kamieniu Filozoficznym |journal=Biblioteka Problemów |year=1971 |volume=164 |pages=83–84 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d0gaAQAAMAAJ |language=pl |issn=0137-5032}}</ref> Sendivogius found, between 1598 and 1604, that the substance in air is the same as he got by heating [[potassium nitrate]]. Some people believe this was the discovery of oxygen while others disagree. Some say that oxygen was discovered by [[Sweden|Swedish]] pharmacist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]. He got oxygen in 1771 by heating [[Mercury(II) oxide|mercuric oxide]] and some [[nitrate]]s.<ref name="ECE499"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/8/oxygen |title=Oxygen  |publisher=RSC.org |access-date=December 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name="ECE500"/> Scheele called the gas "fire air", because it was the only gas known to allow combustion (gases were called "airs" at this time). He published his discovery in 1777.<ref name="NBB300">[[#Reference-idEmsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 300</ref>

On 1 August 1774, [[UK|British]] clergyman [[Joseph Priestley]] focused sunlight on [[mercury(II) oxide|mercuric oxide]] in a [[glass]] tube. From this [[experiment]] he got a gas that he called "dephlogisticated air".<ref name="ECE500">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p. 500</ref> He found that candles burned more brightly in the gas and a mouse lived longer while [[breathing]] it.

[[France|French]] chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] later said he had discovered the substance as well. Priestley visited him in 1774 and told him about his experiment. Scheele also sent a letter to Lavoisier in that year that spoke of his discovery.<ref name="NBB300"/>

===Lavoisier's research===
[[File:Lavoisier decomposition air.png|thumb|left|Lavoisier decomposition air]]
Lavoisier did the first main experiments on [[oxidation]]. He was the first person to explain how combustion works.<ref name="ECE500"/> He used these and other experiments to prove the phlogiston theory wrong. He also tried to prove that the substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a [[chemical element]].

In one experiment, Lavoisier found that there was no increase in [[weight]] when [[tin]] and air were heated in a closed [[container]]. He also found that air rushed in when the container was opened. After this, he found that the weight of the tin had increased by the same amount as the weight of the air that rushed in. He published his findings in 1777.<ref name="ECE500"/>  He wrote that air was made up of two gases. One he called "vital air" (oxygen), which is needed for combustion and respiration. The other ([[nitrogen]]) he called "azote", which means "lifeless" in [[Greek language|Greek]]. (This is still the name of nitrogen in some languages, including [[French language|French]].)<ref name="ECE500"/>

Lavoisier renamed "vital air" to "oxygène", from Greek words meaning "sour making" or "producer of [[acid]]". He called it this because he thought oxygen was in all acids, which is wrong.<ref name="mellor">{{cite book|last1=Parks|first1=G. D.|last2=Mellor|first2=J. W.|date=1939|title=Mellor's Modern Inorganic Chemistry|edition=6th |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London}}</ref> Later chemists realised that Lavoiser's name for the gas was wrong, but the name was too common by then to change.<ref>Greenwood & Earnshaw, pg. 793</ref>

"Oxygen" became the name in the [[English language]], even though English scientists were against it.

===Later history===
[[John Dalton]]'s theory of [[atom]]s said that all elements had one atom and atoms in compounds were usually alone. For example, he wrongly thought that water (H<sub>2</sub>O) had the formula of just HO.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Interactive Textbook of PFP96 |chapter= Do We Take Atoms for Granted?|chapter-url=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/subsubsection1_1_3_2.html |url=http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/Contents.html |first1=Dennis |last1=DeTurck |last2=Gladney|first2=Larry|last3=Pietrovito|first3=Anthony| publisher=University of Pennsylvania|date=1997|access-date=January 28, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117230939/http://www.physics.upenn.edu/courses/gladney/mathphys/subsubsection1_1_3_2.html |archive-date = January 17, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1805, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]] showed that water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

Appleton and Co.}}</ref>

By the late 19th century, scientists found that air could be turned into a liquid and the compounds in it could be isolated by [[compression|compressing]] and cooling it. [[Switzerland|Swiss]] chemist and physicist [[Raoul Pictet]] discovered [[liquid]] oxygen by [[evaporation|evaporating]] [[sulfur dioxide]] to turn [[carbon dioxide]] into a liquid. This was then also evaporated to cool oxygen gas in order to turn it into a liquid. He sent a [[telegram]] to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] on 22 December 1877 telling them of his discovery.<ref name="BES707">{{cite book|title=Biographical Encyclopedia of Scientists|last=Daintith|first=John|date=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0287-6|page=707}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
===Properties and molecular structure===
At [[standard temperature and pressure]], oxygen has no [[colour]], [[odour]] or [[taste]]. It is a gas with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|O|2}} called dioxygen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/chemistry/oxygen.html|title=Oxygen Facts|publisher=Science Kids|date=February 6, 2015|access-date=November 14, 2015}}</ref>

As ''dioxygen'' (or just ''oxygen gas''), two oxygen [[atom]]s are [[chemical bond|chemically bound]] to each other. This bond can be called many things, but simply called a [[covalent]] [[double bond]]. Oxygen gas is very [[reactivity|reactive]] and can react with many other elements. [[Oxide]]s are made when [[metal]] elements react with oxygen, such as [[iron oxide]], which is known as [[rust]]. There are a lot of oxide compounds on Earth.

===Allotropes===
The common [[allotrope]] (type) of oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). This is the second biggest part of the Earth's atmosphere, after dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). O<sub>2</sub> has a bond length of 121 [[picometre|pm]] and a bond [[energy]] of 498 [[Joule per mole|kJ/mol]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Chieh|first=Chung|title=Bond Lengths and Energies|url=http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/c120/bondel.html|publisher=University of Waterloo|access-date=December 16, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214215455/http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/c120/bondel.html|archive-date=December 14, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Because of its energy, O<sub>2</sub> is used by complex life like [[animal]]s.

[[Ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) is very reactive and damages the [[lung]]s when breathed in.<ref name="GuideElem48">{{cite book|title=Guide to the Elements|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoelements00stwe|edition=Revised |first=Albert|last=Stwertka|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=1998|isbn=978-0-19-508083-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guidetoelements00stwe/page/48 48]–49}}</ref> Ozone is made in the upper [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] when O<sub>2</sub> combines with pure oxygen made when O<sub>2</sub> is split by [[ultraviolet radiation]].<ref name="mellor" /> Ozone absorbs a lot of radiation in the UV part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and so the [[ozone layer]] in the upper atmosphere protects Earth from radiation.

Above the ozone layer, (in [[low Earth orbit]]s), atomic oxygen becomes the most common form.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=July 2, 2020|url=http://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/help/background/atmosphere/erosion.html|title=Atomic oxygen erosion|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613121048/http://www.spenvis.oma.be/spenvis/help/background/atmosphere/erosion.html |archive-date = June 13, 2007|url-status=dead |quote=atomic oxygen, the major component of the low Earth orbit environment}}</ref>

===Physical properties===
Oxygen [[solubility|dissolve]]s more easily from air into water than [[nitrogen]] does. When there is the same amount of air and water, there is one molecule of O<sub>2</sub> for every 2 molecules of N<sub>2</sub> (a [[ratio]] of 1:2). This is different to air, where there is a 1:4 ratio of oxygen to nitrogen.

Earth is strange compared to other [[Solar System|planets]], as a large amount of its atmosphere is oxygen gas. [[Mars]] has only 0.1% {{chem|O|2}} by volume, and the other planets have less than that.

The much higher amount of oxygen gas around Earth is caused by the oxygen cycle. [[Photosynthesis]] takes hydrogen from [[water]] using [[Photolysis|energy from sunlight]]. This gives off oxygen gas. Some of the hydrogen combines with [[carbon dioxide]] to make [[carbohydrates]]. [[Respiration]] then takes oxygen gas out of the atmosphere or water and turns it into carbon dioxide and water.

==Uses==
[[File:Home oxygen concentrator.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An [[oxygen concentrator]] in an [[emphysema]] patient's house|alt=A gray device with a label DeVILBISS LT4000 and some text on the front panel. A green plastic pipe is running from the device.]]

===Medical===
O<sub>2</sub> is a very important part of [[respiration]]. Because of this, it is used in medicine. It is used to increase the amount of oxygen in a person's [[blood]] so more respiration can take place. This can make them become healthy quicker if they are ill. [[Oxygen therapy]] is used to treat [[emphysema]], [[pneumonia]], some [[heart]] problems, and any [[disease]] that makes it harder for a person to take in oxygen.<ref name="ECE510">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.510</ref>

===Life support===
Low-pressure O<sub>2</sub> is used in [[space suit]]s, surrounding the body with the gas. Pure oxygen is used but at a much lower pressure. If the pressure were higher, it would be poisonous.<ref name="pmid11541018">{{cite journal|author=Morgenthaler GW|author2=Fester DA|author3=Cooley CG| title=As assessment of habitat pressure, oxygen fraction, and EVA suit design for space operations|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_acta-astronautica_1994-01_32_1/page/39|journal=Acta Astronautica |volume= 32|issue=1|pages=39–49|year=1994|pmid=11541018|doi=10.1016/0094-5765(94)90146-5|bibcode = 1994AcAau..32...39M }}</ref><ref name="pmid2730484">{{cite journal|author=Webb JT|author2= Olson RM|author3=Krutz RW|author4=Dixon G|author5=Barnicott PT|title=Human tolerance to 100% oxygen at 9.5 psia during five daily simulated 8-hour EVA exposures|journal=Aviat Space Environ Med|volume=60|issue=5|pages=415–21|year=1989|pmid=2730484|doi=10.4271/881071}}</ref>

===Industrial===
[[Smelting]] of [[iron ore]] into [[steel]] uses about 55% of oxygen made by humans.<ref name="NBB301">Emsley 2001, p.301</ref> To do this, O<sub>2</sub> gas is [[injection|injected]] into the ore through a [[lance]] at high pressure. This removes any [[sulfur]] or [[carbon]] from the ore that would not be wanted. They are given off as [[sulfur oxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. The temperature can go as high as 1,700&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] because it is an [[exothermic reaction]].<ref name="NBB301"/>

Around 25% of oxygen made by humans is used by chemists.<ref name="NBB301"/> [[Ethylene]] is reacted with O<sub>2</sub> to make [[ethylene oxide]]. This is then changed to [[ethylene glycol]], which is used to make many products such as [[antifreeze]] and [[polyester]] (these can then be turned into [[plastic]]s and [[fabric]]s).<ref name="NBB301"/>

The other 20% of oxygen made by humans is used in medicine, [[welding|metal cutting and welding]], [[rocket fuel]], and [[water treatment]].<ref name="NBB301"/>

==Compounds==
The [[oxidation state]] of oxygen is −2 in nearly every [[Chemical compound|compound]] it is in. In a few compounds, the oxidation state is −1, such as [[peroxide]]s. Compounds of oxygen with other oxygen states are very uncommon.<ref>[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]: [http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf ''Red Book.''] p.&nbsp;73 and 320.</ref>

===Oxides and other inorganic compounds===
[[Water]] ({{chem|H|2|O}}) is an [[oxide]] of [[hydrogen]]. It is the most common oxide on Earth. All known [[life]] needs water to live. Water is made of two hydrogen atoms [[covalent bond]]ed to an oxygen atom (oxygen has a higher [[electronegativity]] than hydrogen).<ref>{{cite web|title=Water Hydrogen Bonding|last=Chaplin|first=Martin|url=http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hbond.html|access-date=January 6, 2008|date=January 4, 2008|archive-date=October 10, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010055658/http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hbond.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> (this is the basic principle of covalent bonding)
There are also electrostatic forces (Van de'r Waals forces) between the hydrogen atoms and adjacent molecules' oxygen atoms. These pseudo-bonds bring the atoms around 15% closer to each other than most other simple liquids. This is because Water is a [[polar molecule]] (Net asymmetrical distribution of electrons) due to its bent shape, giving it an overall net field direction, mainly due to oxygens 2 non bonding pairs of electrons, pushing the bonding H's further together than the linear arrangement with lower enthalpy (see CO<sub>2</sub>). This property is exploited by microwaves to oscillate polar molecules, especially water. And its responsible for the extra energy needed to disassociate H<sub>2</sub>0.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=P.|last1=Maksyutenko|first2=T. R.|last2=Rizzo|first3=O. V.|last3=Boyarkin|year=2006|title=A direct measurement of the dissociation energy of water|pmid=17115729|journal=J. Chem. Phys.|page=181101 |doi=10.1063/1.2387163|issue=18|volume=125|bibcode = 2006JChPh.125r1101M}}</ref>

Because of oxygen's high electronegativity, it makes [[chemical bond]]s with almost all other chemical elements. These bonds give [[oxide]]s (for example [[iron]] reacts with oxygen to give [[iron oxide]]). Most [[metal]]'s surfaces are turned into oxides when in [[air]]. Iron's surface will turn to [[rust]] (iron oxide) when in air for a long time. There are small amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|C|O|2}}) in the air, and it is turned into [[carbohydrates]] during [[photosynthesis]]. Living things give it off during [[respiration]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Lesley E.|last1=Smart|last2=Moore|first2=Elaine A. |title=Solid State Chemistry: an introduction| url=https://archive.org/details/solidstatechemis00smar|edition=3rd |publisher=CRC Press|date=2005|page=[https://archive.org/details/solidstatechemis00smar/page/214 214]|isbn=978-0-7487-7516-3}}</ref>

===Organic compounds===
Many [[organic compound]]s have oxygen in them. Some of the classes of organic compounds that have oxygen are [[Alcohol (chemistry)|alcohol]]s, [[ether]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[carboxylic acid]]s, [[ester]]s, and [[amide]]s. Many organic [[solvent]]s also have oxygen, such as [[acetone]], [[methanol]], and [[Isopropyl alcohol|isopropanol]]. Oxygen is also found in nearly all [[biomolecule]]s that are made by living things.

Oxygen also reacts quickly with many organic compounds at, or below, [[room temperature]] when [[autoxidation]] happens.<ref name="ECE506">Cook & Lauer 1968, p.506</ref>

== Industrial production ==
[[File:Compressed gas cylinders.mapp and oxygen.triddle.jpg|thumb|The cylinder on the right holds liquid oxygen.]]
One hundred million tonnes of O<sub>2</sub> are gotten from air for industrial uses every year. Industries use two main methods to make oxygen. The most common method is [[fractional distillation]] of [[Liquid air|liquefied air]]. N<sub>2</sub> [[evaporate]]s while O<sub>2</sub> is left as a [[liquid]].<ref name="NBB299" /> O<sub>2</sub> is the second most important industrial [[gas]]. Because it is more economical, oxygen is usually stored and transported as a [[liquid]]. A small steel tank of 16 [[Litre|liters]] water capacity with a working [[pressure]] of 139 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (2015 psi) holds about 2150 liters of gas and weighs 28 [[kilogram]]s (62 lb) empty. 2150 liters of oxygen weighs about 3 kilograms (6.6 lb).

The other main method of making oxygen is by passing a stream of clean, dry air through a pair of [[zeolite]] [[molecular sieve]]s. The zeolite molecular sieves soak up the nitrogen. It gives a stream of gas that is 90% to 93% oxygen.<ref name="NBB299" />

Oxygen gas can also be made through [[electrolysis of water]] into molecular oxygen and [[hydrogen]].<ref name="NBB299" />

== Safety ==
[[File:Symptoms of oxygen toxicity.png|thumb|350px|The [[symptoms]] of oxygen poisoning.]]
Oxygen's [[NFPA 704]] says that compressed oxygen gas is not dangerous to health and is not flammable.<ref name=nfpa>{{cite web|url = http://www.rivcoeh.org/Portals/0/documents/guidance/hazmat/bep_nfparatings.pdf|publisher = Riverside County Department of Environmental Health|access-date = August 22, 2017|title = NFPA 704 ratings and id numbers for common hazardous materials|archive-date = July 11, 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190711171240/http://www.rivcoeh.org/Portals/0/documents/guidance/hazmat/bep_nfparatings.pdf|url-status = dead}}</ref>

===Toxicity===
At high [[pressure]]s, oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) can be dangerous to [[animal]]s, including [[human]]s. It can cause [[convulsion]]s and other [[health]] problems.<ref group=lower-alpha>Since {{chem|O|2}}'s partial pressure is the fraction of {{chem|O|2}} times the total pressure, elevated partial pressures can occur either from high {{chem|O|2}} fraction in breathing gas or from high breathing gas pressure, or a combination of both.</ref><ref name="ECE511">[[#Reference-idCook1968|Cook & Lauer 1968]], p.511</ref> Oxygen [[toxicity]] usually begins to occur at pressures more than 50 kilo[[Pascal (unit)|pascals]]&nbsp;(kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen in the air at standard pressure (air on Earth has around 20% oxygen).<ref name="NBB299"/>

[[Premature birth|Premature babies]] used to be placed in boxes with air with a high amount of O<sub>2</sub>. This was stopped when some babies went [[blindness|blind]] from the oxygen.<ref name="NBB299"/>

Breathing pure O<sub>2</sub> in space suits causes no damage because there is a lower pressure used.<ref>{{cite web|last = Wade|first = Mark|year = 2007|url = http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/spasuits.htm|title = Space Suits|publisher = Encyclopedia Astronautica |access-date=December 16, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213122134/http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/spasuits.htm |archive-date = December 13, 2007}}</ref>

===Combustion and other hazards===
Concentrated amounts of pure O<sub>2</sub> can cause a quick [[fire]]. When concentrated oxygen and [[fuel]]s are brought close together, a slight [[ignition]] can cause a huge fire.<ref name="astm-tpt">{{cite conference|editor1-last=Werley|editor1-first=Barry L|year=1991|work=Fire hazards in oxygen systems |title=ASTM Technical Professional training|publisher=ASTM International Subcommittee G-4.05|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> The [[Apollo 1]] crew were all killed by a fire because the air of the capsule had a very high amount of oxygen.{{refn|No single ignition source of the fire was conclusively identified, although some evidence points to an arc from an electrical spark.<ref>Report of Apollo 204 Review Board NASA Historical Reference Collection, NASA History Office, NASA HQ, Washington DC</ref>|group=lower-alpha}}<ref name="chiles">{{cite book|last=Chiles|first=James R.|date=2001|title=Inviting Disaster: lessons from the edge of technology: an inside look at catastrophes and why they happen |location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc.|isbn=978-0-06-662082-4}}</ref>

If liquid oxygen is spilled onto [[organic compounds]], like [[wood]], it can [[explode]].<ref name="astm-tpt" />
